# Weekly Meeting-1                             
Held at: September 19, 2017 08:30 PM

## What did the team do last week?
This is the first official week of our project. Last week, we brainstormed ideas for this project. 

**Dipro's idea:** Betting game application where 2 users can place bets on events/games occurring.

**Aditi's idea:** 1) Mario game with new modifications, or 2) facial recognition game where a user "wins" by making the same facial expressions the game displays.


## What is the team going to do next week?
**Arsh:** Will be exploring the Greenfoot game engine and will identify what resources the game engine offers with regards to our 3 application ideas.

**Suhel:** Will be exploring the MelonJS game engine and will identify what resources the game engine offers with regards to our 3 application ideas.

**Dishant:** Will be exploring the Unity game engine and will identify what resources the game engine offers with regards to our 3 application ideas.

**Aditi:** Will be exploring new game ideas, Javascript libraries, and exploring the game engines to determine which will be the best fit for our game development needs.

**Dipro:** Will be exploring new game ideas and the MelonJS game engine to determine which will be the best fit for our game development needs.

We will all be working as a team to collaborate/discuss which engine, game idea, and libraries will be the most time-cost effective and resourceful for our development.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
We are all fairly new to design patterns and gaming Javascript engines, and we are unfamiliar with the different resources each offers. However, after the research we will do this week, we hope to have a better grasp on what is available to us. 

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, September 23rd 2017
