# Weekly Meeting-5
Held at: October 19th, 2:00PM

## What did the team do last week?
In the last week, we completed the following tasks:

1. Team members continued with sample game development in MelonJS in order to become more familiar with the game components and have portions of the game ready for the actual game. 
2. We worked on deciding the design patterns based on their potential usages in our game.
3. Explored the TILED tool for buildinig maps and tile sets.
4. Started looking for game resources and refining game features
5. Shaped up the game design by identifying the key components and building them individually.
6. We made sure every one is familier withe the envrionment.

## What is the team going to do next week?
This week, we will be working on a multitude of areas in order to get our demo up and running. First off, we will be working to find good sprite characters and objects, and using these to create textures for our game. We will use these sprites as our main character and will also have the sprites include "unhealthy" and "healthy" objects. In addition, we will have to figure out a way to end the game, display the score, and provide the user options to restart or exit the game. We will also work on creating the menu for the start of the game, character collisions, and adding a game timer.

**Aditi:** End game when player dies or time runs out, update scoring mechanism, display score and time needed to complete at the end of the game, display options to restart or exit game.  

**Arshdeep:** Find the sprites  for main character, healthy, and  unhealthy objects. The create texture file for production usage and rendering the objects on the game map.

**Suhel:** Implement the timing aspect of the game by implementing a timer using melonJS featurtes and rendering the timer on game. The game must end when user runs out of time.

**Dishant:** Create logic for character collisions with healthy and unhealthy objects. The velocity and jumps should change according to the collected objects.

**Dipro:**  Create a splash screen and initial menu for the game. Design the initial screen and provide a GUI menu to start the game.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
We are trying to coordinate many aspects of the game at once for maximum productivity and progress, and working at such a fast pace is leading to merging issues. We need to make a design choice regarding the components which are not available in melonJS game engine in order to complete the game. 

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, October 28th 2017
