# Weekly Meeting-3
Held at: September 30, 2017, 03:00PM

## What did the team do last week?
As part of project research, team completed the following tasks:

1. Explored Design patterns:
All team members researched on design patterns in general. We explored the idea of implementing the patterns in our project learnt the merits of using them. Team decided to start picking common patterns and start getting formal with them. 

2. Selection of features:
We started brainstorming the features for our game and started defining the scope of the game. We collaborated to jot down the ideas on checked in google document. 

3. Object usage in javascript:
All team is new to the idea of using objects in javascript so we decided to start getting familiarized with that idea. Document was created and checked in.

3. Collaboration of knowledge:
As every team member had a different task, we created documents for cross references and helping other to cope up.

## What is the team going to do next week?
Next week, we will be continuing to work on our Features List and Detailed Specifications document. Additionally, we will be each be working on mock-up screens for portions of the game. These mock-ups will be in development throughout our project, as our requirements and design needs might change. Based on last week's research, we have picked our game engine to be MelonJS, and in the upcoming week, we will be installing and setting up the envrionment on our laptops. Each of us will also set up a demo game in order to experiment and become familiar with the environment.

If we have time, we will also begin the UML model and sequence diagrams for our application.

**Aditi:** Set up MelonJS environment, build a sample MelonJS project, work on Features document, decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Arshdeep:** Set up MelonJS environment, build a sample MelonJS project, work on Features document, decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Suhel:** Set up MelonJS environment, build a sample MelonJS project, work on Features document, decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Dishant:** Set up MelonJS environment, work on Features document, javascript usage,decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Dipro:** Set up MelonJS environment, build a sample MelonJS project, work on Features document, decide on recommended design pattern, design 1-2 mock-up screens, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
We have started defining the scope of our game but we are not sure how design documents are created for systems like a game. We are not sure what should be the high level diagrams that we should create as per process. Secondly, no one has mastered implementing patterns in Javascript, so we need more clarity on their selection and implementation in the game. Additionally, most of us are not familiar with MelonJS, which is why one of our main tasks for this week was to build a sample game in the MelonJS environment after setting it up on our individual computers. Hopefully, after this week, we will be more familiar with the MelonJS environment and will be able to begin building a prototype game.

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, October 7th 2017
