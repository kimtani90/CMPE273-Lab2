# Weekly Meeting-2                            
Held at: September 23, 2017, 03:00PM

## What did the team do last week?
As part of project research, team completed the following tasks:

1. Explored game engines:
All team members picked one game engine and explored it. We compared the features and APIs of all game engines so as to select one from all the options. 

2. Selection of ideas and libraries:
Team listed top three ideas on table and started online research for libraries which could be used in our game. We found sample tutorials and running examples on relevant libraries.(Example CLM library) 

3. Collaboration of knowledge:
As every team member has a different task, we created documents for cross references and helping other to cope up.

## What is the team going to do next week?
Next week, we will be finalizing our decision for our Javascript application. Once we have decided which game we will be building, we will begin research on design patterns to decide which pattern would be the best to implement for our project idea. Each of us will pick a design pattern to do research on, and we will later choose our design pattern based on this research.

Additionally, we will work together to create a Features document, which will outline the features our game will have. In order to be specific and have a "definition of done", we will write a detailed explanation for each of the features we choose to implement in our game.

Once we have the list of features complete, we will each design a "mock-up" screen for our game for different stages of the game. 

If we have time, we will also begin the UML model and sequence diagrams for our application.

**Aditi:** Vote for game, work on Features document, research on design pattern, design 1 mock-up screen, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Arshdeep:** Vote for game, work on Features document, research on design pattern, design 1 mock-up screen, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Suhel:** Vote for game, work on Features document, research on design pattern, design 1 mock-up screen, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Dishant:** Vote for game, work on Features document, research on design pattern, design 1 mock-up screen, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

**Dipro:** Vote for game, work on Features document, research on design pattern, design 1 mock-up screen, and begin UML model/sequence diagrams.

## What are the current blockers/challenges the team is facing?
As we need to implement the game in design patterns, we need to learn them first. We need to have a fair idea on which pattern could be applied in which scenario. Moreover, the team has never used object orientation aspect in javascript, so we need to clarify the object usage in javascript as well.

## Next meeting is scheduled for: Saturday, September 30th 2017
